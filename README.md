# ChordsPractice
An Android application which let's you refine your piano chords.

## What the Application does

This Java Android application randomly displays and shows how to play a piano chord (musical term for a triad of notes). It has been built to tackle a specific problem/difficulty for many pianists. The technology used is plain Java and the build tool is Gradle. As an IDE it is highly recommended to use Android Studio which I myself have used to create this project.


### Prerequisites
This project requires Java 8 SDK and the Build Tool Gradle to deploy.
Having Android Studio is definitely a good idea to simply import and customize this project.
